Resources &amp; code snippets used for the Arduino Workshop Series

## Overview

The workshop would be held over the course of 4 weeks, whereby the following topics would be covered: 

- Basics of electronics
- Programming (Arduino & a sprinkle of C++): Syntax, Variables, and more
- Digital & Analog I/O
- Component interfacing (Passive/Active)
- Using pre-written libraries
- Timers & Interrupts

## Organisation
The repository would contain the code snippets that are used in conjunction with the workshop, where the directory would be labeled as Week 1, etc.

### WK1 - WK4
The code snippets used in week 1 to 4 are found in the respective directories.
- WK1: LEDs (digitalWrite, analogWrite via PWM), Arduino Syntax
- WK2: Electronics Basics + Breadboarding, Serial Monitor (Output), Button (digitalRead), Button Debouncing, AnalogRead (Potentiometer, LDR)
- WK3: Serial Monitor (Input), Piezo Speaker, Ultrasonic Sensor
- WK4: Servos, EEPROM Read/Write, Interrupt & Timer

### WK7_practice
This week session serves as a practice and revision for arduino. The solutions are also located int this directory.
